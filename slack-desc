glitz: Glitz (An OpenGL image compositing library)
glitz:
glitz:   Glitz provides Porter/Duff compositing of images and implicit mask
glitz: generation for geometric primitives including trapezoids, triangles,
glitz: and rectangles.
glitz:   The semantics of glitz are designed to precisely match the
glitz: specification of the X Render extension. Glitz does not only implement
glitz: X Render features like component alpha and image transformations, but
glitz: also support for additional features like convolution filters and
glitz: color gradients, which are not currently part of the X Render
glitz: specification.
glitz:   The performance and capabilities of glitz are much dependent on
glitz: graphics hardware. Glitz does not in any way handle software
glitz: fall-backs when graphics hardware is insufficient. However, glitz will
glitz: report if any requested operation cannot be carried out by graphics
glitz: hardware, hence making a higher level software layer responsible for
glitz: appropriate actions.
glitz:   Glitz can be used as a stand-alone layer above OpenGL but is also
glitz: designed to act as a backend for cairo, providing it with OpenGL
glitz: accelerated output.
